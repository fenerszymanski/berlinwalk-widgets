## 2026-05-15 — Codex

**Did:**
- Read `AGENTS.md` and the latest `SESSION_LOG.md` entry
- Confirmed the handoff files were committed/pushed and the worktree is clean on `main`
- Recorded that Yusuf rotated the leaked Wix API key and deleted the old key
- Updated local E7 source so the primary CTA points to the per-booking Berlin Walk review form
- Updated live Wix automation metadata so both E7 actions expose `order_number` and `booking_contact_first_name`

**Changed:**
- `AGENTS.md` — removed the completed Wix API key rotation TODO
- `SESSION_LOG.md` — added this handoff entry
- `email-journey/README.md` — recorded current E7 action/message IDs and Wix automation revision 7
- `email-journey/e7-post-tour-review-request.md` — replaced FreeTour review ask with the Berlin Walk review form URL
- `email-journey/mockups/e7-wix-html-block.html` — made "Leave a review" the primary CTA using `${order_number}` and `${booking_contact_first_name}`
- Wix: patched automation `16a0d96d-9a1d-4107-ad5c-c3d21c6d8da1` from revision 6 to 7; both E7 actions now include `{{var("order_number")}}`

**Opened:** Paste/publish the updated E7 HTML in both Wix Triggered Email templates (`8a0dcaab-...` and `22ff0a12-...`); REST cannot write Triggered Email body content.
**Closed:** Wix API key rotation; local E7 content update; E7 automation dynamic params

**Next session should:** Paste the updated E7 Wix HTML block into both live E7 Triggered Email templates, then test the cancel-on-cancel automation end-to-end with a real test booking and cancellation.

## 2026-05-15 — Claude Code

**Did:**
- Built the full per-booking review system end-to-end (form, public display, FreeTour imports, cancellation cleanup hook)
- Rebuilt the 7-email automation as a branched structure to prevent burst-firing on last-minute bookings
- Designed cancellation email HTML matching the brand system

**Changed:**
- `email-journey/` — added 7 email markdown drafts + README + `mockups/` folder with 14 HTML files (browser preview + Wix-paste versions for E1–E7)
- `leave-review/index.html` — new iframe widget for review submission
- `reviews/index.html` + `reviews/reviews-element.js` — new `bw-reviews` Custom Element + local test page
- `.gitignore` — excludes `email-journey/.automation-*.json` backups
- Wix: created Reviews CMS collection with 11 custom fields (bookingId, firstName, lastInitial, showName, country, rating, reviewText, tourDate, guestEmail, approved, source, sourceUrl)
- Wix: added 3 Velo HTTP functions to `backend/http-functions.js` — `submitReview`, `listReviews`, `cancelBookingJourney`
- Wix: created new automation `16a0d96d-9a1d-4107-ad5c-c3d21c6d8da1` to replace the unreachable draft `01909883-...`, with a CODE_CONDITION branching long-path (≥3 days) vs short-path (<3 days). Used `booking_creation_date` variable; `now()` was unreliable at runtime.
- Wix: created parallel automation "Cancel 7-email journey on booking cancellation" — Booking Canceled trigger → HTTP POST `bookingId` → calls Wix `cancelEvent` API
- Wix: created `/leave-review` and `/reviews` pages, embedded iframe + Custom Element respectively
- Wix: imported 6 existing FreeTour testimonials into the Reviews collection (`source=FreeTour.com, approved=true`) via REST API
- Wix: customized the shipped "Notify clients when their booking is canceled" email template with brand-aligned HTML (designed as Yusuf-initiated apology)

**Opened:**
- Test the cancel-on-cancel flow end-to-end (book + cancel, verify logs and E2 suppression)
- Update E7 email to link to `berlinwalk.com/leave-review?bid=${order_number}&n=${booking_contact_first_name}`
- Convert homepage `bw-testimonials` to read live from `listReviews` instead of `testimonials/data.json`
- Convert `/leave-review` to a Custom Element (currently iframe; mobile height is a workaround)
- Rotate Wix API key (leaked in chat during this session)

**Closed:**
- Reviews collection + Velo + leave-review form (built and live)
- Country field added end-to-end
- Branched cadence with corrected `booking_creation_date` variable
- FreeTour reviews imported into single source of truth
- Cancellation email designed
- Cancel-on-cancel automation wired (not yet tested)

**Next session should:** Test the cancel-on-cancel flow with a real test booking + cancellation, watching `console.log` output for `cancelEvent status: 200`. If that works, ship E7's review CTA update next.
